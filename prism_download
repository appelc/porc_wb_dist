    ## this isn't going to work -- we get individual annual files and would need to calculate 
    ## normals somewhow, and also resample the rest of the predictor rasters to 4km
    
## So, use just the 800m 30-year annual normals I already have for 1981-2011
## And for 2012-2018, use those 30-year normals as well as LEMMA predictors
