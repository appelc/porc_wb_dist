There is a creek very near there, beach grass-covered dunes and patches of dense woods, some pastures with sheep and cows and no houses because there is Otter Point State Park there.  In the 5 years that I have lived here and walk in that area with my dog almost daily, I have seen a porcupine in that same area about 5 times.  One time, unfortunately, I found one killed by a car and took a cell phone picture.  It seemed to me like it was not fully grown.  :(

I went into the forest to circle around for a different angle. As I entered the forest a great gray owl flew from its perch and went off through the dense trees.

You are welcome to the data, and the photo, if you want it. Just credit the info/photo, as appropriate. There wasn't much more data than the observation showed, it was spotted just inside the entrance to Leadbetter State Park, on the left side of the road. It was indifferent to us stopping and photographing it, and I took the picture from the bed of our truck, just to be safe. We sat alongside it for about 15 minutes, while it nibbled away on the vegetation. Good luck with your project!

I took that photo on a family hike along the White River on 27 August 2010.  The porcupine seemed surprisingly unconcerned about my presence and continued to eat oak leaves about 6 ft off the ground while I took photos.  It was still eating when I left.
Here is the estimated location of that photo.  It may have been a few hundred meters downstream (still on the northern side of the river), but I think it was at this spot.

I have another wildlife friend (he does wildlife tech work) who lives in Oregon and loves to deploy his trail camera and go on photography hikes.  He probably has some porcupine sightings that he can share.  Would you like me to ask him?  
Cheers,
Tati""","y"
